Requiers PHP5+ and mysql and a webserver I use apache but that should not matter

The basic setup Requires you to Clone the repository
Then Make an alias pointing /CMSExample to the CMSExample directory where the repository is stored

- to Make the base Data base use the createbasicdb.sql script, this will create a user with the name 'user1' and password 'password' you can use this account to create new users


- to get the sql connection working you run the make.bat or make.sh


Simple instructions - Windows users

Install WAMP

Cut and paste the createbasicdb.sql into phpmyadmin (localhost/phpmyadmin click SQL >> paste data >> click go)
